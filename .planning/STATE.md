**Current focus:** v1.1 Documentation & Developer Portal

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1
Phase: 01 of 02 (README Rewrite with ASCII Art Branding) — COMPLETE

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decisions log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.1/01 Plan 01 decisions:**
- Use HTML comment markers (`<!-- PLACEHOLDER -->`) in README so sections render cleanly if downstream plans don't fill them
- Hero banner: 62-char checkpoint box width (╔══╗) matching ui-brand.md checkpoint box dimension
- Section dividers: stage banner pattern (━━━) inside fenced code blocks above each ## heading
- Footer Discord/docs URLs: placeholder values (discord.gg/vit-claude, vit-claude.dev) — not found in repo

**v1.1/01 Plan 02 decisions:**
- Compact table format (not per-command headings) for 31-command reference — fits density requirement
- ASCII dividers use ─── style inside fenced code blocks per group, consistent with Plan 01 section header pattern
- Descriptions taken verbatim from description: frontmatter field of each command file
- /vit:set-profile included as /vit:set-profile even though frontmatter omits vit: prefix

**v1.1/01 Plan 03 decisions:**
- Agent descriptions sourced directly from frontmatter of each agent file, not from memory
- vit-verifier and vit-integration-checker spawn source identified via command files (execute-phase, audit-milestone) since their own descriptions omit "Spawned by"
- Model profile matrix matches model-profiles.md exactly (11 agents x 3 profiles)
- Sample config.json shows all 11 keys at documented defaults

**v1.1/01 Plan 04 decisions:**
- Emoji ✅ ❌ 🔄 inside fenced CI example code blocks are acceptable — they represent literal GitHub comment output, not decorative document emoji
- No README changes needed — all prior plans produced a consistent, clean document

**v1.1/01 Plan 05 decisions (gap closure):**
- diff code block (not HTML spans/font tags) used for hero banner color — broadest GitHub compatibility
- Subtitle lines kept without + prefix for neutral/white color, contrasting the green ASCII art
- Old box-drawing frame (╔══╗) removed — diff block provides sufficient visual framing

### Pending Todos
